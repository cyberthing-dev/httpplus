hi welcome to http plus. It's a high-level, dynamic HTTP server for Python. Quickly deploy simple servers, or customize complex, 
high-performance ones.
One of the ways I believe that HTTP frameworks can be improved is by directly interfacing with the socket connections. You are currently looking at the `socket-main` branch, which accomplishes this by using Python's native `socketserver.TCPServer` library. I also believe that this branch will greatly improve the low-level functionality of HTTPPlus. This branch will probably not get merged until the main version begins seeing use and I get active contributors.
